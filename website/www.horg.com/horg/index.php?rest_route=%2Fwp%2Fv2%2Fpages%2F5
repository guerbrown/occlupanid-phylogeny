The principal feature of an occlupanid is its &#8216;oral groove&#8217;, an invagination in what we&#8217;re pretty sure is the anterior region of the body.

Many of these plasticae sport a dizzying array of markings; often spelling out cryptic phrases like &#8220;SellByJUN02&#8221; and &#8220;MFG 10996C&#8221;. Field observation has determined that these markings are used to identify an occlupanid as part of a group, though what purpose a parasite has for a tribe is unclear. Some researchers believe that these markings are genetic &#8216;fingerprints&#8217; and record them for purposes of lineage and distribution. These are the researchers who have the most free time on their hands, it should be mentioned.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/xray_demetrius_01.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" title=\"xray_demetrius_01\" src=\"http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/xray_demetrius_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/xray_demetrius_01.jpg 239w, http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/xray_demetrius_01-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>All dissection and radiographic attempts have so far indicated that the body is uniformly composed of a stiff, yet flexible plastic. Although some researchers have performed experiments to determine the breaking point of this substance, these were denounced some years ago as being cruel and pointless, and have since been abandoned. Suffice to say, a loss of one of these hooks spells doom for the occlupanid.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"description\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Occlupanid Morphology Occlupanids are totally adapted to a life of parasitism.
