Eliot of Edinburgh performed an experiment to test the bread\/occlupanid relationship and found evidence to suggest that when occlupanids are removed from bread bags, the sliced bread can suffer from premature hardening and fungal infection.<\/p>\n<p>In Supermarket biomes the Bag to Occlupanid ratio is 100 percent, but once the bag leaves the supermarket, that ratio drops off sharply. It is thought that once outside the supermarket environment, the occlupanid eventually drops off to reproduce, then die.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1120\" style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/occlu_chains1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1120\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1120\" title=\"occlu_chains1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/occlu_chains1-254x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"254\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/occlu_chains1-254x300.jpg 254w, http:\/\/www.horg.com\/horg\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/occlu_chains1.jpg 402w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1120\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samples of attached occlupanid chains<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Rarely, chains of occlupanids are found, offering evidence that their life cycle is far more complex than previously imagined.
