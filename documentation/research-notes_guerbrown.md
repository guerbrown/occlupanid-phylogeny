My first thought with this project is that a simple comparison of various morphological features using our own intepretations is no different than previous work. Rather, it is not innovative nor does it remove the simplest problem with morphological comparison-- perspective. So, how can we perform a non-biased comparison of shapes, size, color, etc. for the sake of occlupanid evolution? I am starting to believe the answer to this is statistical comparison. 

Occlupanids can be easily compared on only two dimensions and each "species" is holotyped on a standard background. These two features make this a suitable situation for procrustean superimpostion. I do have some experience with the general stats for this (Ward et al., 2024).

The concern of this approach is detailed in Cardini 2022, where the author suggests procrustes analysis is "biologically arbitrary" for morphological comparison. This is reasonable in a living system with natural variation. However, occlupanids are not neccessarily "biological" *en sensu lato*.
